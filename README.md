# Aperture photometry for HST, PanSTARRS and WISE images 

We performed the isophotal analysis with the ELLIPSE routine using Python-based IRAF.
Unrelated neighboring galaxies and stars were masked out prior to the fitting. The isophotal profiles (surface brightness, ellipticity, and position angle (PA) versus radial distance) extracted from the optical and UV images, respectively, are presented in the Appendix (Figures 11–18). All of the host galaxies in the sample exhibit isophotal distortions indicating complex structure.
Photometry was derived based on the 1σ isophote (i.e., the isophote with intensity 1 standard deviation above the mean of the sky background) selected as the integration aperture. Systematic uncertainty in the computed magnitudes was derived by adding the Poisson noise in source flux and rms error from the sky background, in quadrature.
The photometric measurements were corrected for Galactic extinction using the scaling relation by Cardelli et al. (1989) and the E(B−V) color excess sourced from the NASA/IPAC archive.
